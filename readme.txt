* SEO information about you link partner's site included (PR, number of cached pages, Alexa rating, ...). Refresh this information with just a single click.
* Improved backlink searching algorithm.
* Don't delete your links, just move it the trash and you can always recycle it!
* Improved user interface - no popups used.
* Source was redone from scratch according to highest WordPress standards.
