Embed videos (FLV, H.264, and MP4) into posts or pages.

== Description ==

Custom HTML 5 video on your own site with Flash fallback for legacy browsers is here.

FV Wordpress Flowplayer WordPress plugin is a free, easy-to-use, and complete solution for embedding FLV or MP4 videos into your posts or pages. With MP4 videos, FV Wordpress Flowplayer offers 98% coverage even on mobile devices.

* **New:** Automated checking of video mime type for logged in admins on MP4 videos
* FV Flowplayer 5 is the only completely responsive WordPress video player.
* Custom start and end screens are built right in. You can use your own custom design before and after the video.
* Enjoy unlimited instances in a single page.
* No expensive plugins: unlike other players who nickel and dime you for every feature, with FV Flowplayer all advanced features are available in the standard license (Google Analytics, Cuepoints, Native fullscreen, Keyboard shortcuts, Subtitles, Slow motion, Random seeking, Retina ready)
* Beautiful playlists which you can skin with CSS.
* Ultra-efficient player: just 43kB of JavaScript and 4kB of Flash code. You can extend Flowplayer using just HTML and CSS, leaving the JavaScript heavy lifting up to us.
* 98% Browser coverage. Built-in Flash fallback will get the job done on older browsers.
* Full support for Amazon S3 and other CDN's.
* Totally Brandable. Stop selling YouTube and start selling yourself. Even design your own player.

To remove our branding and add your own branding and get access to additional pro support, [you can buy your own license here](://foliovision.com/wordpress/plugins/fv-wordpress-flowplayer/buy).

Licenses are on a May Day half price launch sale for May 2013. Don't miss out!

**Additional Technical information**

* Plugin based on opensource version of Flowplayer 5.

* In comparison with Wordpress Flowplayer plugin, there are several improvements:

	3. Allows user to display popup box after the video ends, with any HTML content (clickable links, images, styling, etc.)
	4. Allows to upload videos and images through WP Media Library
	5. Does not use configuration file, but Wordpress Options

== Installation ==

There aren't any special requirements for FV Wordpress Flowplayer to work, and you don't need to install any additional plugins.

   1. Download and unpack zip archive containing the plugin.
   2. Upload the fv-wordpress-flowplayer directory into wp-content/plugins/ directory of your wordpress installation.
   3. Go into Wordpress plugins setup in Wordpress administration interface and activate FV Wordpress Flowplayer plugin.
   4. Optionally, if you want to embed videos denoted just by their filename, you can create the /videos/ directory located directly in the root of your domain and place your videos there. Otherwise, you would have to type in a complete URL of video files.
   5. Go to plugin Settings screen and click both "Check template" and "Check videos" buttons to check your template and videos mime type.

   
== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I'm having issues with splash end or loop functions =

Currently these don't work when the Flash fallback player is used. So they only work if your browsers supports the video format natively (read more about video formats in next question). One of the next version should have this fixed.

= My video doesn't play in some browsers =

This should be related to your video format or mime type issues.

Each browser supports different video format, MP4 is the recommended format: http://flowplayer.org/docs/#video-formats

Each browser supports different video format, MP4 is the recommended format. In general, it's recommended to use constant frame rate. Detailed instructions about [video encoding for HTML 5](http://foliovision.com/wordpress/plugins/fv-wordpress-flowplayer/encoding).

It seems HTML5 is more picky about what video it can play than Flash.

Please note that MP4 is just a container, it might contain various streams for audio and video. You should check what audio and video stream are you using. Read next question to find out how.

= How to check my video properties using the built-in checker and how to report video not playing =

* Login to your site as administrator (please use the browser in which the video is not playing for you)
* Double check Settings -> FV Wordpress Flowplayer -> "Front-end video checker" is set to "Enabled"
* Come to any post which was video
* A message in top left corner of the video should appear saying: "Checking the video file...". The check takes usually 1-2 seconds.
* Once it's finished, it changes color based on what problem is detected and you can click it to get video details.
* The dialog also includes our tips on how to resolve the issues found. There is also a button labeled "Send to Foliovision" which sends your video with details straight to our private support tickets.

Note: The checker works much better for local files (on the same server as site). For the remote files, we only grab first 2MB of the file, store it temporarily in your uploads folder, analyze it and then delete. Since we don't get the full file, some values might not be correct, but basic things like codecs should be not affected.

= My video doesn't play in Internet Explorer 9 and 10 =

Most of the issues is caused by bad mime type on the server which serves your video files. Our plugin contains an automated checked for this - just click the "Check Videos" button on the plugin Settings screen.

Here's how to fix the mime type:

**If your videos are hosted on a standard server:**

You need to put the following into your .htaccess:

`AddType video/mp4             .mp4
AddType video/webm            .webm
AddType video/ogg             .ogv
AddType application/x-mpegurl .m3u8
AddType video/x-m4v           .m4v
# hls transport stream segments:
AddType video/mp2t            .ts`

This can be also done in the Apache configuration. If you are on Microsoft IIS, you need to use the IIS manager. 

**If you host videos on Amazon AWS:**

They might be served with bad mime type too - "application/octet-stream". This largely depends on the tool which you use to upload your videos. Using your Amazon AWS Management Console, you can go though your videos and find file content type under the "Metadata" tab in an object's "Properties" pane and fix it to "video/mp4" (without the quotes, of course different video formats need different mime type, this one is for MP4). There are also tools for this, like S3 Browser Freeware, good place for start is here: https://forums.aws.amazon.com/thread.jspa?messageID=224446

Good example can be seen in our support forum: http://foliovision.com/support/fv-wordpress-flowplayer/how-to/how-to-set-correct-mime-type-on-videos-hosted-by-amazon

Also for Internet Explorer, it's not recommended to use MPEG-4 Visual or MPEG-4 Part 2 video stream codecs.

= How do I fix the bad metadata (moov) position? =

If you are using Mac, open the video in Quick Time Pro and in the Movie Properties -> Video Track -> Other Settings turn on the "Cache (hint)" - [screenshot](http://drop.foliovision.com/webwork/it/quick-time-pro-cache-hint.png).

If you are using Windows, try this tool: http://www.datagoround.com/lab/

There are also server-side tools for fixing of this written in Python and there one for PHP, but it fails on videos bigger than the PHP memory limit.

= I'm using OptimizePress template. =

First click the "Check template" button on the pluging settings screen. It will likely report an issue like:

`It appears there are multiple Flowplayer scripts on your site, your videos might not be playing, please check. There might be some other plugin adding the script.
Flowplayer script http://site.com/wp-content/themes/OptimizePress/js/flowplayer-3.2.4.min.js is old version and won't play. You need to get rid of this script.`

The problem with this template is that it includes that old Flowplayer library without using the proper Wordpress function to add a new script (wp_enqueue_script). You need to go through the template and make sure the script is not loading.

There is also a workaround - on each page what is using one of the OptimizePress custom templates, check Launch Page & Sales Letter Options --> Video Options --> "Activate Video" and enter "<!-- FV Flowplayer -->" into Launch Page & Sales Letter Options --> Video Options --> "External Player Code" field. That way the template thinks the video is external and will not try to put in the Flowplayer library and the video will play.

= Does this plugin support Shoutcast? =

Unfortunatelly HTML5 does not support live broadcasting. Please read about it here under "Flash. The good parts": http://flowplayer.org/docs/#flash

= I get an error message like this when activating the plugin: Parse error: parse error, unexpected T_STRING, expecting T_OLD_FUNCTION or T_FUNCTION or T_VAR or '}' in /wp-content/plugins/fv-wordpress-flowplayer/models/flowplayer.php on line 4 =

You need to use at least PHP 5, your site is probably still running on old PHP 4. 

= I installed the plugin, inserted the video, but it's not working, only a gray box appears. =

Go to plugin Settings screen and hit "Check template" button. It will check if both jQuery library and Flowplayer JavaScript is loading properly.

= You player works just fine, but there are some weird display issues. =

Please check if these issues also appear when using the default Wordpress template. There seems to be some sort of conflict between the Flowplayer CSS and your theme CSS.

= How to make this plugin WPMU compatible? =

Just copy the plugin into wp-content/plugins and then activate it on each blog where you want to use it.

= Is there a way to force pre-buffering to load a chunk of the video before the splash screen appears? =

This option is not available. With autobuffer, it means every visitor on every visit to your page will be downloading the video. This means that you use a lot more bandwidth than on demand. I know that I actually watch the video on only about 1/3 of the pages with video that I visit. That saves you money (no bandwidth overages) and means that people who do want to watch the video and other visitors to your site get faster performance.
If you want to autobuffer, you can turn that on in the options (we turn it off by default and recommend that it stays off).

= My videos are hosted with Amazon S3 service. How can I fill the details into shortcode? =

Just enter the URL of your video hosted on Amazon S3 as the video source.

= I would like to localize the play again button. =

Currently there is no support for other languages.

= Where can I change the default directory for videos? =

You can change this manually in the the models/flowplayer.php in the flowplayer_head function. It you use videos in widgets you might need to edit the function flowplayer_content in controller/frontend.php as well. Please be carefull when editing source codes.

= How do I insert flowplayer object outside the post, for example to a sidebar? =

You need to use following code to include the shortcode into a sidebar:

echo apply_filters('the_content', '[flowplayer src=yourvideo.mp4 width=240 height=320]');

Fill the Flowplayer shortcode part according to your needs. The apply filter needs to be called because the flowplayer shortcodes are not parsen outside posts automatically. Also, please do not forget to add the echo at the beginning.

= How do I get rid of the extra blank line below the player? =

To get rid of the spacing, just add this into your template CSS, assuming that your theme uses the standard #content ID on the main content wrapper DIV:

`#content .flowplayer { margin: 0 auto; }`

Also make sure the [fvplayer] shortcode is located on it's own line in the editor and there is not text or any code on the same line. 

= How can I style the popup or ad? =

Check out .wpfp_custom_popup and .wpfp_custom_ad in /fv-wordpress-flowplayer/css/flowplayer.css. You might want to move your changes to your template CSS - make sure you use ID of container element, so your declarations will work even when the flowplayer.css is loaded later in the head section of your webpage.

= Is there a way to remove the share (embed) button? =

Yes, there's a global option in settings to disable sharing/embed. We plan to add an individual flag on a per video basis to allow sharing when sharing is turned off globally and vice versa.

= My videos are taking long time to load. =

1. Check your hosting for download speed.
2. Try to use different settings when encoding the videos, try to turn on the cache when encoding with [Quick Time](http://drop.foliovision.com/webwork/it/quick-time-pro-cache-hint.png)

= How do I insert videos in playlist? =

Playlist feature is not supported right now.

= How can I change the play icon? =

You need to copy the CSS from the Flowplayer CSS (default theme) and put it into your theme CSS. Also add some element ID in front of it to make sure it overridsed the default Flowplayer CSS:

`#content .is-paused.flowplayer .fp-ui{background:url({PATH TO YOUR IMAGE}.png) center no-repeat;background-size:12%;}
#content .is-rtl.is-splash.flowplayer .fp-ui, #content .is-rtl.is-paused.flowplayer .fp-ui{background:url({PATH TO YOUR IMAGE-rtl}.png) center no-repeat;background-size:12%}
@media (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2){
  #content .is-splash.flowplayer .fp-ui, #content .is-paused.flowplayer .fp-ui{background:url({PATH TO YOUR IMAGE@2x}.png) center no-repeat;background-size:12%}
  #content .is-rtl.is-splash.flowplayer .fp-ui, #content .is-rtl.is-paused.flowplayer .fp-ui{background:url({PATH TO YOUR IMAGE-rtl@2x}.png)}
}`

The image needs to be 100x106px normal version nad 200x212px hi res version. You only have to include the RTL version if your site runs in such language.

= Volume control in player looks weird =

Make sure you are not using obsolete tags like &lt;center&gt; to wrap the video. Such tag is not supported in HTML5, you have to use CSS to center elements.

= How do I get rid of the 'Hit ? for help' tooltip on the player box? =

You can put this into your template's functions.php file, if you know a bit of PHP. It will disable the tooltip.

`add_filter( 'fv_flowplayer_attributes', 'tweak_fv_flowplayer_attributes', 10, 2 );
function tweak_fv_flowplayer_attributes( $attrs ) {
	$attrs['data-tooltip'] = 'false';
	return $attrs;
}`

= How can I customized the player control bar? I want to add a play/pause button. =

Just put this code into the template's functions.php file. If you know a bit of PHP, it should not be a problem for you:

`add_filter( 'fv_flowplayer_attributes', 'tweak_controlbar_fv_flowplayer_attributes', 10, 2 );
function tweak_controlbar_fv_flowplayer_attributes( $attrs ) {
	$attrs['class'] .= ' play-button';
	return $attrs;
}`

It simply adds a class "play-button" to the player DIV element and then it knows to use the play button. The other options are:

`no-mute
no-time
no-volume`

= What if the FV Flowplayer 5 doesn't work for me? =

No worries.

1. You can always downgrade to version the Flash version ([here's how](http://foliovision.com/wordpress/plugins/fv-wordpress-flowplayer/downgrading)). You do lose a lot of mobile and iOS capability but you didn't have it in the first place.
1. Contact us via [support](http://foliovision.com/support). We are actively investigating and fixing people's sites now during the initial release period. We will help you to get FV Flowplayer 5 working in your environment.

FV Flowplayer 5 Pro comes with a money back guarantee so you can even try the commercial no-branding version risk free. Or make it work first with the free versions.

Thank you for being part of the HMTL 5 mobile video revolution!

== Other Notes ==

This new version uses Flowplayer 5 running on HTML5, so we recommend you read first two questions of FAQ first.

Once the plugin is uploaded and activated, there will be a submenu of settings menu called FV Wordpress Flowplayer. In that submenu, you can modify following settings:

* AutoPlay - decides whether the video starts playing automatically, when the page/post is displayed.
* AutoBuffering - decides whether te video starts buffering automatically, when the page/post is displayed. If AutoPlay is set to true, you can ignore this setting.
* Popup Box - decides whether a popup box with "replay" and "share" buttons will be displayed when video ends.
* Enable Full-screen Mode - select false if you do not wish the fullscreen option to be displayed.
* Allow User Uploads - select true if you like to upload new videos via Media Library.
* Enable Post Thumbnail - select true if you wish the screen shot appear as post thumbnail. Works only when uploading new splash image via Media Library.
* Convert old shortcodes with commas - older versions of this plugin used commas to sepparate shortcode parameters. This option will make sure it works with current version.
* Commercial Licence Key - enter your licence key here to get the completely unbranded version of the player
* Colors of all the parts of flowplayer instances on page/post (controlbar, canvas, sliders, buttons, mouseover buttons, time and total time, progress and buffer sliders).

On the right side of this screen, you can see the current visual configuration of flowplayer. If you click Apply Changes button, this player's looks refreshes.
