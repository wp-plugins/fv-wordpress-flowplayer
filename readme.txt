== Description ==

FV Wordpress Flowplayer plugin is a free, easy-to-use, and complete solution for embedding FLV or MP4 videos into your posts or pages.

* Plugin is completely non-commercial. It contains modified opensource version of Flowplayer 3.1.3, with removed FP logo and copyright notice.
* Supported video formats are FLV, H.264, and MP4. Multiple videos can be displayed in ope post or page.
* Default options for all the embedded videos can be set in comprehensive administration menu.
* It is loosely based on Wordpress Flowplayer plugin. However, there are several improvements:

	1. Doesn't use jQuery, so there will be no future conflicts with other plugins.
	2. Usage is simpler and forgiving, making the plugin easier to use.
	3. It will never display any annoying flowplayer logos or copyrights over your videos.
	4. Allows user to display clickable splash screen at the beginning of video (which not only looks good, but improves the performance significantly).
	5. Allows user to display popup box after the video ends, with any HTML content (clickable links, images, styling, etc.)

== Installation ==

There aren't any special requirements for FV Wordpress Flowplayer to work, and you don't need to install any additional plugins.

   1. Download and unpack zip archive containing the plugin.
   2. Upload the fv-wordpress-flowplayer directory into wp-content/plugins/ directory of your wordpress installation.
   3. Make sure, that configuration file wpfp.conf is writable.
   4. Go into Wordpress plugins setup in Wordpress administration interface and activate FV Wordpress Flowplayer plugin.
   5. Optionally, if you want to embed videos denoted just by their filename, you can create the /videos/ directory located directly in the root of your domain and place your videos there. Otherwise, you would have to type in a complete URL of video files.

== Screenshots ==
